# Features
## Bookmarks
SparkleMuffin allows you to:

- save, tag and search your Web bookmarks;
- import your existing bookmarks from a Web browser or another bookmarking application,
  using the [Netscape Bookmark File Format](../developers/architecture/netscape.md);
- share your public bookmarks so they can be accessed by a Web browser or as an
  Atom feed.

## Web interface
SparkleMuffin aims at providing a Web interface that is:

- simple to use;
- minimalist and clutter-free;
- accessible on Web browsers for both desktop and mobile devices;
- light on Javascript.

## Database
SparkleMuffin is backed by a PostgreSQL database, which allows multiple users to
log in to the same instance, and eases administration, backup and maintenance.

## Roadmap
See the [changelog](../changelog.md) for past releases, and the
[milestones](https://github.com/virtualtam/sparklemuffin/milestones) for upcoming
