# Contributing to SparkleMuffin
SparkleMuffin is still in an early stage of development, and as such, you may find some
rough edges and missing features.

The goal of the project is to experiment with writing a Web-based tool that can be
used to save, tag and retrieve bookmarks for the Websites you visit, while keeping
its interface simple to use, clutter-free and responsive for mobile devices.

If this sounds interesting to you, please keep on reading!
